# federatedDDoS
DDoS defense using Federated Learning

## Files/Folders
- **FL_FedAvg_tutorial.ipynb**: simple tutorial on federated learning with federated averaging on MNIST dataset
- **FL_Trusted_FedAvg.ipynb**: federated learning with trusted federated averaging on MNIST dataset
- **preprocessing**: contains script used for preprocessing of original datasets and a demo notebook that analyzes the preprocessing procedure followed

## Next steps
- Build simple model with 2 layers (check appropriate activation function etc.)
- Check trust with new dataset and model
- Check results in relation to size of data used (i.e. how much can we crop original datasets)
- Unbalanced data
- Heterogeneous models
